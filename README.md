Neural Modeling of Action Recognition and associated psychophysical experiments.

Shall include routines for stimuli generation, executed experiments using PTB plus analysis and a neural model extended from Giese-Poggio 2003.

Presently stimuli generation routines are not included, and about 30% of the modelling code is not yet in the repository(pending refactoring).
